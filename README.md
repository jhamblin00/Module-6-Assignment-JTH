# Module-6-Assignment-JTH

In this module 6 assignment we are given four different bits of code all with something that needs to be adapted or configured to work a certain way or give us a certain output. Being given random bits is definitely not as straight forward as when you have started a program from start to finish where you know the purpose of everything and what everything is supposed to do. That being said this was slightly difficult for me in that regard although the instructions/hints helped to guide me in the right direction.

Code 1

This is the problem that was confusing in terms of what the purpose was originally because there was not too much to go off of but that being said made more sense as I got more into it. The more obvious correction to make dealt with the print function as it needed to be updated to the current python 3. The other thing that made sense after establishing what data was in the 3rd line was to apply it and use it in line 5 to have it do anything. That being said after correcting all of this nothing was printed or done that I could see and I would have to attribute this to the fact that the code is supposed to supposedly format items according to the cost which is something we are not given but overall this seems to have fixed what I felt needed to be fixed.

Code 2

This bit of code was pretty straight forward as we were instructed to establish timedeltas that added a day as well as subtracted 60 seconds and added 2 years. Given the hint in the instructions I just adapted the words in the hint to give the correct output and to adjust the the time accordingly.

Code 3

This problem like the last was also easy enough to understand the direction in which we needed to go. The first thing I did with the original bit of code was to add the print function to display the results of subtracting a single microsecond from the current datetime. Following that we needed to adapt the code to display a time delta that added up to 100 days, 10 hours, and 13 minutes. After calculating how many minutes total went into that amount of time I used it to give me the second line of the output which equals the correct time. That being said when I would try to add g.hours to display the amount of hours I kept experiencing problems and it would never end up showing them but the minutes in the output accounted for the 10 hours and 13 minutes so in that regard it is fine.

Code 4

For the final bit of code we were to establish an argument or function that took in 2 inputs; feet and inches. Defining a function was the first step and then telling it to tell the viewer the result of the tow inputs was the following step. After defining the function we needed to take in the actual inputs for them to be displayed and also add in the datetime object so the date and time could be paired with the time in which the user inputs the height given.
